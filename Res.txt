P = I^2 R
P = V^2/R

Circuit Rules
Rule 1: In a series circuit the current will be the same all the way around
Rule 2: in a parallel circuit the amps will add up to the total amps supplied.
Rule 3: In a series circuit the volts will add up to the total volts supplied.
Rule 4: In a parrallel circuit the voltage will be the same for each lamp as the supply voltage.
Rule 5: The brightness of a bulb depends on the current and voltage, so the brightness depends on the overall power, P=IV
