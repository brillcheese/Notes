Concave Mirrors (interesting *shiny*)
Using f, the focal length and C, the centre of curvature
(sometimes called the radius), where C = r = 2f
The object is beyond C
The image will be an inverted image/reduced in size/real
  
The object is at C
The image will be inverted/equal to the object size/real.
  
The object is between C & F
The image will be inverted/larger/real.
  
The object is at F
When the object is located at the focal point, no image is formed.
  
The object is in front of F
The image will be
upright/magnified/virtual. The image is behind the mirror.

Convex Mirrors (dull *no pun intended*)
Object
Regardless of the position of the object the image will always be virtual/upright/ reduced in size. The image is behind the mirror. The image is located behind the mirror by tracing the rays back to where they appear to come from.
For all mirrors:
• If d; is behind the mirror/virtual it is negative
• The image height, h, for a virtual image is negative
• The focal length for a convex mirror is negative

Convex Lenses (interesting)
Ray diagrams for Convex Lenses
1. A ray parallel to the principal axis will be refracted through F behind the lens.
2. A ray that passes through F in front of the lens will be refracted parallel to the principal axis.
3. A ray that passes through the centre of lens (the pole) will continue with no change in direction
Using f, the focal length and C, the centre of curvature
(where C= r = 2f):
The object is beyond C
The image will be
inverted/reduced in size/real.
  
The object is at 2F
The image will be inverted/ equal to the object size/real.
  
The object is between C & F
The image will be inverted/larger/real
  
The object is at F
When the object is located at the focal point, no image is formed.
No Image is Formed

The object is in front of F
The image will be an upright image/magnified/virtual. The image is located on the object's side of the lens.

Concave Lenses (dull)
Ray diagrams for Convex Lenses
1. A ray parallel to the principal axis will be refracted away from as if it has come from the focal point F in front of the lens
2. A ray that heading towards F behind the lens will be refracted parallel to the principal axis.
3. A ray that passes through the centre of lens (the pole) will continue with no change in direction
Regardless of the position of the object the image will be virtual/upright/reduced in size. The image is located on the object's side of the lens by tracing the rays back to where they appear to come from.
For all lenses:

• If di is the same side as the object it is negative
• The image height, h; for a virtual image is negative
• The focal length for a concave lens is negative
